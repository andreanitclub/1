                What is Green Computing? Green computing, also called green technology, is the environmentally
                responsible use of computers and related resources. According to this definition isn’t computing
                already green? We can all agree that if you’re sending emails, you’re not using paper. One tree
                approximately makes 8,333 sheets of typical 20 lb weight copy paper. If we assume one newsletter
                sent to one recipient would consume at least one sheet of paper,<br> 
                20 million emails/day divided by 8,333 = 2,400 trees saved every day! <br><br>
                Just by sending email instead of paper-
                based marketing materials. The online connected World Wide Web is also significantly affecting our
                paper consumption habits, as online publishing at industrial and individual levels with books,
                catalogues on commercial websites, blogs, etc. may slow down the use of paper. Furthermore, online
                newspapers, e-bills, financial payments and transactions, e-tickets and boarding passes save tons of
                paper every day. But as always there’s room for improvement considering the facts stated below.
                Every year, over 2 million computers are dumped in landfill sites, while only 500,000 are
                recycled. Used computer hardware, monitors, hard drives, circuit boards, batteries etc contain
                hazardous materials, including lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium and radioactive
                isotopes. Every color monitor contains approximately 2.5 kilos of lead. The dangerous toxins
                associated with lead are leached from landfill into our waterways and soil, or into the atmosphere via
                incinerated ash. Excessive levels of lead in our bodies result in serious health issues including
                cancer, learning disabilities, behavioral problems, seizures and even death. Almost 5% of e-waste is
                exported to third world countries where recycling methods are unsafe and unregulated. This dumping
                of our waste products in developing countries has resulted in an alarming increase in illnesses
                associated with computer recycle carcinogens in women and children. Although computers seem to
                help us obtain a green environment by reducing the use of paper, but improper disposing and use of
                computers could lead to several issues.<br><br>
                Soaring energy consumption by computers, data centers and mobile devices has many experts
                looking to reduce the energy use of these devices. Most projects today do not focus on efficient
                cooling systems or energy-saving power modes. We often blame the computer hardware for
                excessive use of energy, but energy consumption can be significantly reduced by simply ‘coding
                green’.     <br><br>
                Consider I want to find the greater of two number ‘a’ and ‘b’ <br>
                Case1: using if statements <br><br>
                1. If(a&gt;b) display “ A is the greater number ”<br>
                2. If(a&lt;b) display “ B is the greater number ”<br>
                3. If(a==b) display “ They are equal”<br>
                Case2: using if else statements<br>
                1. If(a&gt;b) display “ A is the greater number ”<br>
                2. Else If(a&lt;b) display “ B is the greater number ”<br>
                3. Else (a==b) display “ They are equal”<br><br>
                
                In case1 we check the condition of lines 1 ,2 &amp; 3 even if the first condition is true, but in case2 if the
                first statement is true it executes it and skips the other condition checks thus saving time and
                resources.
                The efficiency of algorithms affects the amount of computer resources required for any given
                computing function and there are many efficiency trade-offs in writing programs. Algorithm changes,
                such as switching from a slow (e.g. linear) search algorithm to a fast (e.g. hashed or indexed) search
                algorithm can reduce resource usage for a given task from substantial too close to zero. If you can
                afford one error every 100,000 operations, you have already saved a lot of energy. Researchers state
                that computers could use a purely software-based approach to reduce energy consumption. For
                example, the computer could round off numbers or skip some extra accuracy checks on the
                approximate part of the code to save energy but then these computers cannot be used in banks!
                Researchers estimate between 30 and 50 percent savings can be achieved through software alone.
                Combining the software and hardware methods they believe they could cut power use by about 90
                percent.
                Another method of using energy efficiently to achieve the concept of green computing is to move to
                the cloud. Cloud Computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the
                Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer. Cloud
                computing could also refer to as Computer virtualization where the abstraction of computer
                resources is achieved by running processes of two or more logical computer systems on one set of
                physical hardware. Cloud infrastructure addresses two critical elements of a green IT approach:
                energy efficiency and resource efficiency.
                From a resource-efficiency perspective, less equipment is needed to run workloads, which proactively
                reduces data center space and the eventual e-waste footprint as a single physical server is used to
                run multiple operating system images concurrently.  From an energy-efficiency perspective, with less
                physical equipment plugged in, a data center will consume less electricity. The pay-as-you-go nature
                of cloud-based infrastructure encourages users to only consume what they need and nothing more.
                Combined with self-service and life-cycle management will improve the use of energy, since users
                can consume resources only when they need it and &quot;turn off&quot; these resources with set expiration
                times. Ideally, centralized cloud data centers should be powered by renewable sources of energy, like
                wind, solar, or hydroelectricity, but the reality is that even the most energy efficient is typically getting
                70 percent of its electricity from greenhouse-gas-emitting fossil fuels, like coal. Resources are limited
                and should be utilized efficiently in order to save environment. Green ideas that lead to minimize the
                usage of these scare resources should be used as much as possible. Below are some ways
                computer users can help achieve the concept of green computing:
                Replace your desktop with a laptop. A laptop uses five times less energy than a desktop PC.
                Replace your CRT monitor with an LCD monitor. Each replacement of a CRT monitor with an LCD
                monitor saves a significant amount of energy.
                If available, consider buying Green Computers.
                Think about leasing equipment as an alternative to buying.
                While putting a computer into a &quot;standby&quot; or &quot;sleep&quot; mode will save a lot of power, many people
                remain unaware that even shutting down a desktop computer completely does not turn it off. This is
                because the computer&#39;s power supply will remain physically switched on, with the motherboard
                partially powered and waiting for a signal from the switch on the front of the PC to boot up again. To
                actually prevent a desktop computer from using power, after being shut down it must either be
                
                switched off at the wall socket, or turned off using the small rocker switch on the back of the power
                supply. Green IT is about more than just power consumption. It incorporates the entire
                environmental impact of technology, from the paper we load in our high-end networked printers to the
                hazardous e-waste we throw away. Green computing can only be achieved if programmers, hardware
                designers, networkers and users work with an objective to achieve it.    </div>
