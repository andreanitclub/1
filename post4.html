                        That’s how I envision the future to b. If we don’t go green now, we have to wait for it to load in future. <br>
                        We live in the world of technologies. Gadgets have become the basic necessity of human life. We can't live without PCs and mobile phones, so let’s learn how to live with them in a way that makes them friendlier to the environment. <br>
                        Green is the color of the hour. Technology has advanced to such an extent that green computing is not just a movement, it’s a necessity. Green computing also known as green information technology (green IT) is environmentally responsible and eco-friendly use of computers and their resources. The goals of green computing are similar to green chemistry: reduce the use of hazardous materials, maximize energy efficiency, promote the recyclability of defunct products and factory waste and think before you added on to e-waste. Green computing includes the implementation of best practices, such as energy efficiency central processing units (CPUs), peripherals and servers. In addition green technology aims to reduce resource consumption and improve the disposal of electronic waste (e-waste).<br>
                        The origin of Green computing can be traced back in 1992 when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency launched Energy Star, a program designed to promote and recognize energy-efficiency in monitors, climate control equipment, and other technologies. Progressively a few more programs lead to awareness which eventually lead to Green Computing movement. <br>
                        Even the definition faces evolution. Evolving beyond the reduce, reuse and recycle, green computing was re-defined by San Murugesan in 2008 as "the study and practice of designing, manufacturing, using, and disposing of computers, servers, and associated subsystems — such as monitors, printers, storage devices, and networking and communications systems — efficiently and effectively with minimal or no impact on the environment. He considered the following four paths as the best means to addresses the concern:<br><br>
                        *	Green Use – Using resources in such a way that reduces the usage of hazardous materials.<br>
                        *	Green Design – Designing objects and services that comply with the environment.<br>
                        *	Green Disposal – Recycling e-waste with no or little impact on the environment.<br>
                        *	Green Manufacturing – The discovery and development of new products that reduces or eliminates the use or generation of hazardous substances in manufacturing.<br><br>
                        The benefits of green computing is not only restricted to the consumer, or business, or country's standpoint, but a global benefit. Green computing helps reduce energy demands, waste, and money of how we use technology which positively effects the environment, and our costs. For example, a computer left on for "24 hours will cost you between $115-160 in annual electric costs and also produce 1,500 pounds of CO2 in the atmosphere". By simply turning off your computer during the nights, you ultimately can save up to" 67 percent annually in your electric bill", along with reducing greenhouse gases. Overall the benefits of green computing will result in saving money, reducing costs, and conserving energy, along with helping the environment.
                        There are many innovative technologies and tools which make green computing a viable option. You can contribute your bit at various levels:<br><br>
                       <br> *	Organic light-emitting diodes should be used instead of the regular monitors. Using ENERGY STAR qualified products help in energy conservation. The Climate Savers Computing Initiative (CSCI) catalog can be used for choosing green products.
                       <br> *	Donating your old computers and other peripherals can reduce the rate of e-waste creation. Moreover, those who cannot afford to buy a computer can benefit from such donations. 
                        The manufacturing of disks and boxes needed for video games takes up a lot of resources. Video game manufacturers can offer their games online for download, leading to reduction in e-waste. This move can cut down on the transportation/shipping cost. 
                        <br> *	The practice of switching off computers at night helps in saving a considerable amount of energy. Computers are designed for sustaining around 40,000 on/off cycles. Therefore, you need not worry about the computer even if you have to turn it off on a regular basis.
                        As a business- 
                        <br> *	Build energy efficient data centers. An energy efficient data center design includes air management, heat recovery and electrical configuration of data centers in such a way that reduces the energy consumption to a great level. Modern data center design also includes on-site electricity generation and waste heat recycling.
                        <br> *	Business should encourage telecommunication. It is a work arrangement in which people work from home, making use of the internet, telephone and email. The terms teleconferencing, telework or telepresence are often used interchangeably and are used as a method to implement green computing. These technologies offer many advantages such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions related to travel, more work satisfaction and lower costs for office space, heat and lighting.
                        <br><br>Though green computing is largely considered as the future of things, there are still some issues that are barriers to the green computing adoption. For example the “privacy issues” that arise from the recycling of the old computer, costly equipment to implement green data center design and industry regulations. 
                        There are innumerable ways to combine ecology with technology, which we practically are trying a bit of everything. Such as using solar technology, solar technology now is being used on keyboards and mice now to reduce energy costs. Another example is a case study from Apple. Apple computers’ uni-body designs material is a great source to dissipate heat, along with their products being able to conserve energy very well. Not only have they implemented ways in being more eco-friendly by removing hazardous materials in their computers and products, but their manufacturing and delivering their goods has also been altered to help the environment. Not only is green computing effecting components and other various hardware, it has changed in ways businesses use technology such as cloud computing. Cloud computing essentially is a method of a user connecting to a network or server, through the internet. Ultimately this reduces the need of businesses to have purchase more computers, which can emit greenhouse gases when left on.
                        The practice of green computing has essentially branched off to every form of technology out there. Green computing has definitely come a long way, but with so many new innovations coming along in regards of preserving the environment, it is safe to say that green computing is a great development. Let’s work individually and collaboratively to accelerate the great development of Green IT and to contribute as a helping hand to save earth by computing more while consuming less!
