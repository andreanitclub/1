                        In today's world things are made so easy in certain aspects of life. The advancement of technology has made man dependent on the internet for all his needs. Internet has given man easy access to everything while sitting at one place. Like if you are too lazy to go shop or too lazy to go pay your bills well then you can sit at home and shop or pay your bills online. Also if you go to the supermarket you could just swipe you credit card. Money transactions are made so easy for all of us. But so has it increased the number of crimes happening around us. And this crime that has grown in popularity among criminals is identity theft. <br> <br>
                        In our current society since there has been a great deal of technological advances made it is easier than ever for a common criminal to steal a social security number, a bank account number or any other piece of information which could help a criminal gain access to ones personal finances. The cyber crime department in India has the most number of unsolved cases. Only 1 in 700 criminals are convicted for the crimes they have committed which means the rest 699 criminals are preparing to only get better at the cyber crimes. But we also cannot always blame the victims for these crimes by saying they were too careless because even after being cautious, they fall into the traps of these cyber thiefs because certain traps are just not in our hand like credit card clonning or skimming as it is called, is a technique whereby someone obtains your credit card details, copies them onto a bogus card and begins using the credit card under that  persons identity/name.While credit card theft itself is not new, the manner in which the information is stolen is not clear to many people and hence they fall into the traps of these internet thiefs. Well one can always protect themselves from identity theft by protecting your social security number(SNN), not sharing personal information over the phone,in emails and in postal mail, secure your wallet or purse at all time, do not share passwords with family or friends, keep a track of your bills and bank statements and reviewing credit card report once a year. And if you get trapped in an identity breach, its important to immediately close the account hacked or block the card and inform the cyber crime department immediately. <br> <br>
                        The police cannot protect consumers.People need to be more aware and educated about identity theft. You need to be a little bit wiser, a little bit smarter and there is nothing wrong with being skeptical. We live in a time when if you make it easy for someone to steal from you, someone will.
