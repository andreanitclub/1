                    The Impact of Online Identity Theft on Consumers and Organizations Internet fraud has become a major issue due to the ever
                    increasing population of internet users, because the internet is such an easy solution to fast sufficient
                    services readily available for busy lives that’s why most of us are now dependant on the internet in
                    some shape or form and each time we use the internet we input data that are related to use from our name,
                    address and even bank details with the assurance that the site is safe and trustworthy, but this is not
                    always the case because the security system implemented like all things in this world has weaknesses.
                    Online hackers uses programs to penetrate these weaknesses of database system which holds valuable consumer
                    information and data, which they can use for to carry out fraudulent activities such as; credit card
                    scams using stolen identities acquired through the system, or open numerous bank accounts to make overdraft
                    withdrawal using addresses they acquire from the database they’ve hacked. The main areas that online
                    criminals target are bank details and financial records of customers from various organisations that
                    they can get hold of large sums of money so it is worth the risk of hacking. Credit card fraud scheme
                    is when you use your card to shop online, giving details of your account in order to make a purchase, from
                    here if you are careful you can stumble upon a mimicked site that is monitored by fraudsters using a
                    program to record the details entered and these details is then use to make transactions from the victims
                    account into the another account of the criminal or used for purchasing items instead of gaining hard
                    cash, Phishing is a scheme used by fraudsters to ensure online customers to fake websites so they can
                    reveal their bank details either through a purchase or through asking them to verify their account to
                    make sure that the accounts is still active, this had lead to 55% rise in losses from online fraud against
                    banks totally round about 23 millions for the first half of 2006. chip and pin was introduced in 2004
                    in the hope to combat credit card fraud, and did decreased by 13% by the end of 2005, but even with this
                    method in place the percentage of bank losing money from fraud carried out over the telephone, online
                    or mail order rose by 5% and fraud using duplicate or counterfeit cards rose by 16%, this is due to the
                    fact that criminals have access to tools and knowledge to the details of individual magnetic stripes
                    behind a card and the card is then used in places where technology is less high-tech or used abroad because
                    it is hard to detect that the card is being used illegally. Another case of identity theft comes from
                    a Swedish bank Nordea where the bank is unknowingly scammed out of around $1.1 mil through a 3 month
                    time period from customer’s account, of those who had used the internet to access their account and was
                    targeted by the fraudsters using malicious programs to obtain personal login details and then used these
                    details to withdraw. The attackers use the program called Trojan to work over the system like nothing
                    is going on, it then downloads, but the victim is first asked by an automated email sent to them saying
                    that the attach file is an anti-spy ware or anti-spam ware, the Trojan works like a listen for vital
                    details and site that the user visits and records the path that the user takes, after having recorded
                    these information the Trojan then alerts the user that there is something wrong with the page and ask
                    the user to resend the information again, with as little as 2 codes the criminal can access an account
                    to withdraw or make a transfers from one account to another. Due to this big scam the bank had to close
                    down its online operation in 2005 because the system was penetrated once. From these facts we can see
                    that the more user there are the more the bigger the problem with fraud and identity theft becomes, because
                    more users means more data, meaning more for fraudsters to access and steal, from when online shopping
                    was new consumers had an open mind to the new shopping system and was willing to explore with caution,
                    but as this system became more readily available it became easier for criminal to break into these systems
                    through the weak spots. As the problem with identity theft and scams becomes widespread companies beginning
                    to wise up, but by this time it is too late because most customers have lost trust in their security
                    system, especially those small companies, as for the larger companies they implement more expensive security
                    system in the hope to prevent any further attack . Consumers and organisations both suffer a big lost
                    in trust, and on the financial side of things it is fair to say the business suffer a greater lost once
                    their system is penetrated by a fraudster, thus companies who can afford to implement more secure systems
                    for their online sites, they can survive as for small business some would suffer bankruptcy and eventually
                    lead to shutting down the business. The strategy that an organisation should adopt in order to prevent
                    attacks to their database systems includes hiring third party security firms to monitor their systems
                    daily routine transactions and implement more trusted software as an aid to boost the security level.
                    Online customers must also take precautions when visiting any websites that they intent on give data
                    about them self by using have anti-spy wear or virus software to safeguard any programs trying to gather
                    their information.
